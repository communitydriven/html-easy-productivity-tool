Warning: Do not read when you are a "Grammar-Sheriff" or "Fancy-Pants-Full-Of-Color-...-Lover=Opposite of: Lightweight and Speed". All Other People are welcome.<br>
I have created this File for Everyone. It shall help you. The Main Idea is with this to create you favourite THINGS to a List/Table.<br>
It helps: sproductivity, minimalistic, easy, not-confusing, no-time-wasting, everything on one paper, Make life a little easier, Enhance your Workflow and your Funflow<br>
<br>A good tool, Device or System is: Lightweight, not resource-hungry, admin-controll-panel instead unfortunately deleting or moving, and so on(Later-Another Big Community Projekt: No Android,No IOS, Linuxphone on the way)<br>
<br>its a first concept. A HTML page or tool who looks easy and is to enhance your productivity and it gives you an output how you want it.
it is still in progress
and
it is for everyone<br>
At the Moment this Tool makes an Table/List for 2 Topics.<br>
Topic-1 are Programs/Tools/Apps/Devices/Gadget(further i say to that "App=Application") what you use on your Computer or Smartphone. <br>
What is the Benefit of this for you: You get all the Apps one one Paper and whenever you install your Operation System or Buy a new Computer or Device you know what you need and where you get that. Your Productivity will be better and you do not confuse yourself and dont damage your own brain(i dont know right now how to tell it to english the right way).<br><br>
Topic-2 are Webpages, Communitys, Users, Peoples, Teams and so on <br>
Benefits are: We go to the Digital Future. Now we have so much Pages,Contents,Games,Videos,Musik, . . You do not know what to see and how you can focus on which. We go now just to the Example of Youtube now. There are so many Communitys/Groups and Contentcreators you like or not like. Get Focused. Make a list which side you need for what and which Channel you need for what and when you need to look it. (Psychologic dependant). More more more . . . There will be an iframe of youtube where you can see the newest uploads from your Subscription OF THE TOPIC. (youtube do not very good job=> A Rich Company sleeps too long)
<br><br>

Topic-3: todo for you. Give me your wishes.<br>
<br>todo:<br>
1)make the code smaller,lightweight  and resourcething<br>
2)optional: instead of download send the file to email or github or anypage. Afterward get fast the Table from there and upgrade it<br>
3)downloaded file can be uploaded and then i can change the fields instead of write everything again<br>
4)upgrade it a bit for other people, what they like. example: music or movies or what they like is not out there<br>
5)place it to firefox as an addon

#Example of App

Warum aber sind hier unzÃ¤hlige Buttons . . . Weshalb muss eine Seite so complicated sein . . . ðŸ˜­
