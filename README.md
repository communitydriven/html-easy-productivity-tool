Warning: Do not read when you are a "Grammar-Sheriff" or "Fancy-Pants-Full-Of-Color-...-Lover=Opposite of: Lightweight and Speed". All Other People are welcome.<br>
I have created this File for Everyone. It shall help you. The Main Ideo is with this to create you favourite THINGS to a List/Table.<br>
It helps: sproductivity, minimalistic, easy, not-confusing, no-time-wasting, everything on one paper, Make life a little easier<br>
<br>A good tool, Device or System is: Lightweight, not resource-hungry, admin-controll-panel instead unfortunately deleting or moving, and so on(Later-Another Big Community Projekt: No Android,No IOS, Linuxphone on the way)<br>
<br>its a first concept. A HTML page or tool who looks easy and is to enhance your productivity and it gives you an output how you want it.
it is still in progress
and
it is for everyone<br>

2)optional: instead of download send the file to email or github<br>
3)downloaded file can be uploaded and then i can change the fields instead of write everything again<br>
